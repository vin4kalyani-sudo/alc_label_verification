# Test Scenarios

The full catalogue of functional, security, and non-functional test scenarios.

**How each scenario is verified**

- **Auto** means an automated test covers it. The *Evidence* column names the test class. All 110 tests pass with `./mvnw test`.
- **HTTP** means it was checked against a running instance with curl, using the same session, CSRF, and multipart flow a browser uses.
- **Manual** means it needs a person at a browser (visual and interaction checks). The *Result* column says "Not run" until someone executes it.

**Test data:** synthetic labels in [test-labels/](../test-labels/README.md). Bootstrap accounts: `specialist@example.gov` and `applicant@example.com`. The password comes from `APP_SEED_PASSWORD`, or from the startup log.

## 1. Authentication and session

## Running

```bash
./mvnw test
```

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=SyntheticLabelsEndToEndTest
```

For manual scenarios, start the demo profile, read the bootstrap password from the log, and use the synthetic labels:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=demo
```

## Summary

Some scenarios are both automated and verified live, so the columns overlap.
